      <description>Honor Expectations As a student at the University of Virginia, you are trusted to be honorable and expected to behave in ways that merit that trust. We take advantage of this trust to provide a better learning environment for everyone. In particular, students in cs1010 are expected to follow these rules throughout the course:
I will not lie, cheat or steal. If I am unsure whether something would be considered lying, cheating or stealing, I will ask before doing it.</description>

      <description>UVA CS1010 Spring 2024
Computing for Future Leaders and Citizens
Course Goals This course has two main objectives:
Provide you with an understanding of computing that will help you better understand the world today and tomorrow.
Empower you to use computing better.
For both of these goals, we will aim to understand how computers work, what computers can and cannot do, the kinds of questions to ask before trusting a computing systems, and the potential risks when computing systems are misused or abused.</description>

      <description>Project 2: Building the Web For this project, the main goal is for you to:
Develop a good basic understanding of how the web works and how search engines find content on the web. Create your own website, learning to use raw HTML, version control systems (github), and style sheets (css). The first part of this assignment focuses on the second goal, and walks you through the steps to build your own website.</description>
