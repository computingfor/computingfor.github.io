"Computing for Future Leaders and Citizens"

This course has two main objectives:

1. Provide you with an understanding of computing that will help you
better understand the world today and tomorrow.

2. Empower you to use computing better.

For both of these goals, we will aim to understand how computers work,
what computers can and cannot do, the kinds of questions to ask before
trusting a computing systems, and the potential risks when computing
systems are misused or abused.

This course is loosely inspired by Richard Muller's [_Physics for
Future
Presidents_](https://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/PffP.html)
course at Berkeley (and also a [popular
book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_for_Future_Presidents)). That
course aimed to cover what every future world leader needs to
understand about physics, including topics like climate change,
nuclear weapons, and communications.

Today's world leaders still need to understand physics, of course, but
the need to understand computing is at least as essential. Whether you
aspire to be a teacher, create a buisness, become a doctor, or nearly
any other future occupation including just being a functioning citizen
in the modern world, computers will have a dramatic impact on your
lives. Understanding enough about how computing systems work and how
they are built and deployed is essential for being an informed citizen
and making critical decisions that impact yourself and others.
