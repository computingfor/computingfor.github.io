# Project 3: Programming the Web

For this project, the main goal is for you to:

1. Learning about how computers are programmed, how programming languages are defined, and being able to read and write BNF grammars.
2. Getting some experience writing your own JavaScript code.
3. Adding dynamic behavior to your website.

For the first part of the assignment, you will replicate and extend the Countdown/Boom application we built in [Class 15](/post/class15) and [Class 17](/post/class17) (to be done on Thursday). The second part is some questions about language, BNF grammar, and JavaScript programming. For the third part, you will add a photo carousel to the website you build for [Project 2](/project2). The questions part is in the middle to encourage you not to leave this until the end, but you can do Part 2 in any order.

<div class="yellowbox">

**Collaboration and Resources.** For this assignment, we want everyone to create their own website so you should do this assignment and submit your answers to the questions on your own. If you wish, you may work together with one or two other students, including going through the steps here and helping each other with the questions, so long as everyone is creating their own website and understanding all the code you write and every answer you submimt. If you do work with others on this assignment, list them in your submission.

There are no restrictions on the resources you use for this assignment with one exception &mdash; it would violate both the spirit and the value of this assignment if you were to search the course github repository for completed versions of the code and just cut-and-paste that into your solution. This is not allowed, and if you cut-and-paste code without understanding it there is a high likelihood it would be very apparent that this was done, and it would be considered an honor violation. 

Feel free to search the web for helpful resources, use your favorite (or least favorite) chatbot, and examine source code from other web pages. If you do use any code generated by an AI assistant, though, you should be careful to fully understand it. This is important for the goals of this assignment, of course, but important even if you are just using code you find or get an AI assistant to generate for you to make something. Generated code is prone to containing errors, including ones that can result in security vulnerabilities, and can also be prone to [poisoning attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02344) (like we will talk about for image classifiers based on the Wall Street Journal article posted in [Class 17](/post/class17)).

## Getting Started

For this project, you will be building on the website you build for [Project 2](/project2). So, before starting this you need to have complete Project 2. It will be very helpful if you were able to get the local editing with Visual Studio Code to work since this will enable faster editing and testing of the JavaScript code you'll be writing for this project, but it is still possible (although we think quite painful!) to do your editing using the github web interface, and waiting until the site updates to do your testing.

JavaScript is built-in to all major web browsers, and many other devices these days including [drones](https://medium.com/maestral-solutions/programming-the-ar-drone-2-0-using-javascript-and-node-js-part-1-10bb946c60e5) and [tiny microcontrollers](https://www.espruino.com/). You don't need to install anything to start programming in JavaScript &mdash; just add code to an HTML file and load it into your web browser. You will want to use the Developer Tools in your browser to help debugging your code (mostly to be able to see things printed to the Console). You should already be familiar with this from Project 2, but just remember to right-click in the browser and select "Inspect".

## Part 1: Countdown to Boom

The JavaScript code in [jsboom.html](/jsboom.html) is shown below:

```JavaScript
<html>
<body>
    <h1>Exploring the DOM</h1>

    <h2>Count Down: <span id="count">20</span></h2>
    <button onclick="updateCount()">Next</button>

    <script>
        var i = 20;

        function updateCount() {
            i = i - 1;
            countobj = document.getElementById("count");
            console.log("Updating object: " + countobj);
            countobj.innerHTML = "<b>" + i + "</b>";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
You can start by adding the [jsboom.html](/jsboom.html) file (with this code) to your website.

We cover this code in [Class 17](/post/class17), and you should understand everything in it at least at the level we discussed in class. 

<div class="problem">

**Problem 1.** Add an if statement to the `updateCount` function body to do something special when the value of `i` reaches 0. 

</div>

We demonstrate an example of this in [Class 17](/post/class17), and you can use the code from class in your solution to Problem 1. But, you should understand what you use, and try making some changes to it to be sure that you understand it.

<div class="problem">

**Problem 2.** Modify the `updateCount` function body so the background color of the webpage gets gradually redder as the count approaches 0.

</div>


<div class="problem">

**Problem 3.** Add another button to the webpage that does something else. You can be creative and decide what it should do, and experiment with different ways to modify the DOM to make interesting things happen on the webpage. For your response to this question, provide the code you wrote as well as a short explanation of what you added and anything you wanted to do but couldn't figure out how to make it.

</div>

## Part 2: Understanding Languages

This part asks you some questions about BNF grammars (introduced in [Class 16](/post/class16)).

Consider the BNF grammar AB below with starting non-terminal <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span>:

<div class="bnfgrammar">
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">a</span> </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">b</span> </div>
</div>

<div class="problem">

**Problem 4.** Answer each sub-part about the AB grammar above:

a. What are the _non-terminals_ in the grammar?

b. How many strings are in the language produced by the grammar?

c. Is there any string in the language produced by the grammar below that is not in the language produced by the AB grammar above?

<div class="bnfgrammar">
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfempty">&epsilon;</span> <span class="bnfcomment">// Recall &epsilon; means empty (it can be replaced with nothing)</div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">a</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">b</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">S</span></div>
</div>
</div>


Consider the BNF grammar below that resembles part of the JavaScript grammar:

<div class="bnfgrammar">
    <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span> 
        <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeExpression</span>
        <span class="bnfsyntax">(</span>
            <span class="bnfnonterm">AdditiveOperator</span> 
            <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeExpression</span> 
        <span class="bnfsyntax">)<sup>*</sup></span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">AdditiveOperator</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfterm">+</span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">AdditiveOperator</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfterm">-</span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeExpression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MemberExpression</span>
    <span class="bnfsyntax">(</span>
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeOperator</span> 
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MemberExpression</span> 
    <span class="bnfsyntax">)<sup>*</sup></span></div>
        <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeOperator</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfterm">*</span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeOperator</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfterm">/</span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
        <span class="bnfnonterm">MultiplicativeOperator</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
        <span class="bnfterm">%</span>
    </div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MemberExpression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
    <span class="bnfnonterm">Identifier</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MemberExpression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
    <span class="bnfnonterm">Literal</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">MemberExpression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> 
    <span class="bnfterm">(</span><span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span><span class="bnfterm">)</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">Identifier</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnote">a valid name</span></div>
    <div class="bnfrule">
    <span class="bnfnonterm">Literal</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnote">a number like </span><span class="term">23</span></div>

</div>


<div class="problem">

**Problem 5.** 

a. Show that the BNF grammar above can produce <span class="bnfterm">23</span> by showing the derivation (sequence of replacements) from <span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span>.

b. Show that the BNF grammar above can produce <span class="bnfterm">2 + 3 * 6</span> by showing the derivation (sequence of replacements) from <span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span>.

c. Argue convincingly that there is only one way to derive <span class="bnfterm">2 + 3 * 6</span> from the grammar, and in particular, that there is no derivation that would group <span class="bnfterm">2 + 3</span> as one expression (instead of grouping <span class="bnfterm">3 * 6</span> as should have happened in your derivation for part b).

</div>

## Part 3: Creating a Photo Carousel

For the last part of this assignment, you will add a photo carousel to your webpage.

The result should be (at a minimum) something like this where there is an image displayed and a "Next" button that advances to the next image, and after clicking through all the images, the first image will return and cycle again.

<div class="yellowbox">
We're including the code for an example photo carousel here to demonstrate what you are expected to build, but please don't look at the source code for this page! Just copying our code would defeat the purpose of this assignment, and will be extremely obvious to us it you turn it in. 
</div>

<div class="gap"></div>


  <div style="width:800;background:#c5e5f8;padding:2em;">
    <center>
    <img id="carousel-image" height="400" src="" alt="Carousel Image"><br>
    <div class="padded">
      <button onclick="showNextImage()">Next</button>
    </div>
    </center>
    </div>

  <script>
    // Array of image URLs
    var images = [
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2010_09_03-rice-hall/IMG_0590.jpg",
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2010_09_03-rice-hall/IMG_0602.jpg",
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2010-08-23-Shenandoah/IMG_6558.JPG",
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/za2010/0613-0616_kruger/P1010248.JPG",
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/2009_04_24-seattle/gasworks-IMG_3520.JPG",
        "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/death-valley/death-valley-salt-flats.JPG"
    ];

    var currentImageIndex = 0;
    function showImage(index) {
      var carouselImage = document.getElementById("carousel-image");
      carouselImage.src = images[index];
    }

    function showNextImage() {
        currentImageIndex = (currentImageIndex + 1) % images.length;
        showImage(currentImageIndex);
    }

    // Display the initial image
    showImage(currentImageIndex);
  </script>

<div class="problem">

**Problem 6.** Implement a photo carousel on your website. (This can be done on a new webpage, or by modifying one of the pages you already created for Project 2.)
</div>

### Some hints:

You can implement your carousel in any way you want, but here are some (hopefully helpful) hints that assume one way of doing it.

You'll want to create a image element on your page and then update the `src` attribute to change the image. Here's a few code snippets that may be useful for figuring out how to do this:

```html
   <img id="cimage" height="600" src="" alt="Image Changes">
```
This is HTML that would put an image on a webpage. The `id` can be used to obtain the JavaScript object in the DOM that corresponds to this object:

```JavaScript
    var carouselImage = document.getElementById("cimage");
    carouselImage.src = ...; // this is how you update the URL for the image
```

To cycle through the image, you could create an array object that is the collection of images, and then use a variable (similar to the way `i` was used in the countdown application in Part 1). 

To define an array, you can use an <span class="bnfnonterm">ArrayExpression</span>:

<div class="bnfgrammar">
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">ArrayExpression</span></div>
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">ArrayExpression</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">[</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">ElementList</span><span class="bnfterm">]</span></div> 
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">ElementList</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">&epsilon;</span></div>
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">ElementList</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">MoreElements</span></div>
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">MoreElements</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfterm">,</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">Expression</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">MoreElements</span></div>
<div class="bnfrule">
<span class="bnfnonterm">MoreElementsL</span> <span class="bnfsyntax">::=</span> <span class="bnfnonterm">&epsilon;</span></div>
</div>


For example,
```JavaScript
   images = [ 'https://mysiteurl/image1.jpg',
              'https://mysiteurl/image2.jpg',
              'https://mysiteurl/image2.jpg' ] ;
```
Then, we can access elements of an array using the square brackets. For example, `images[0]` would be the first element of the array (`'https://mysiteurl/image1.jpg'`).

If you need more hints, please ask!

<div class="problem">

**Problem 7.** Add something more creative to your website using your advancing JavaScript skills. This could be adding an additional feature to the photo carousel, or something new and more creative. Its up to you to decide what to implement for this, but you should have enough power now to do something interesting!
</div>
