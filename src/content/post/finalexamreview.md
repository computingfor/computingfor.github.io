This updates the [Review Topics](/post/examreview) that were posted before the first exam. The first part is identical to what was posted before, with a new section added to reflect what we have done in [Class 22](/post/class22), [Class 23](/post/class23), [Class 24](/post/class24), [Class 25](/post/class25), and [Class 26](/post/class26).

### Representing Information

- Understanding of the different between analog and digital data interpretations, and be able to explain why nearly all computing is done on digital data. ([Class 1](/post/class1), [Class 2](/post/class2), [Project 1](/project1))

- Ability to convert between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number formats, and to answer questions about how many different values can be represented by a given number of bits or hexadecimal digits. ([Class 3](/post/class3), [Class 4](/post/class4), [Project 1](/project1))

- Be able to perform arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication) on binary data. ([Class 5](/post/class5))

- Understanding of what compression is, the difference between _lossy_ and _lossless_ compression, and what a compression ratio means and what factors influence it. ([Class 4](/post/class4), [Project 1](/project1))

### The Internet and the Web

- Understanding of the basic mechanisms that make Internet-scale search engines possible, including hash functions and reverse indexes. ([Class 6](/post/class6), [Class 7](/post/class7), [Project 2](/project2))

- Be able to explain the difference between _latency_ and _bandwidth_, and how changes to a network design impact each. ([Class 8](/post/class8))

- Understanding of how the Internet works at the level needed to explain traceroute at a high level. ([Class 9](/post/class9), [Class 10](/post/class10))

- Understanding of the structure of HTML, including URLs, links, and elements. ([Class 8](/post/class8), [Project 2](/post/project2))

### Trust on the Internet

- Understanding of what a domain name is and what it means to own a domain name. ([Class 11](/post/class11))

- Understanding of what encryption is and the properties that and encryption and decryption function should have in both _symmetric_ and _asymmetric_ cryptography. ([Class 12](/post/class12))

- Be able to state _Kerckhoffâ€™s Principle_ and answer whether or not a cryptosystem design satisfies it. ([Class 12](/post/class12))

- Understanding of how we are able to trust a website we visit is the one we expect, including how the TLS protocol establishes a secure channel between our client and a web server, and how certificates work in TLS. ([Class 13](/post/class13))

### Programming

- Be able to read short fragments of JavaScript code and answer questions to show you understand what it means. ([Class 15](/post/class15), [Class 17](/post/class17), [Class 18](/post/class18), [Class 19](/post/class19), [Class 20](/post/class20), [Class 21](/post/class21); [Project 3](/project3))

- Be able to write JavaScript code to do a simple computation. You do not need to memorize the syntactic details, and are not expected to be able to write exact code, but should be able to show enough that a reader would be convinced that with access to a JavaScript interpreter and time to debug, you could get the code working. ([Class 15](/post/class15), [Class 17](/post/class17), [Class 18](/post/class18), [Class 19](/post/class19), [Class 20](/post/class20), [Class 21](/post/class21); [Project 3](/project3))

- Understanding of how BNF grammars describe languages, and ability to determine the set of strings in a given BNF grammar, and to define a BNF grammar for a given language. ([Class 16](/post/class16), [Class 19](/post/class19), [Project 3](/project3))

- Understanding of the edit distance algorithm and code, sufficient to answer questions about it. ([Class 20](/post/class20), [Class 21](/post/class21))

### Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

- Be able to speak intelligently about why it is so difficult to define _artificial intelligence_, and explain the problems with attempts to define it.

- Understanding Turing's imitiation game operational test of whether a machine can _think_, and what we can and cannot learn from such a test.

- Be able to explain how Turing defined a _machine_, and why such a simple formal notion of a machine is a reasonable model for the complexity of modern computers.

- Explain how machine learning, which trains a model using data, differs from traditional programming.

- Understand the basic methods of machine learning including parameterized models, model architectures, and loss functions.

- Be able to explain why Large Language Models like ChatGPT are prone to producing plausible text that is not grounded in facts (sometimes called _hallucinations_).
