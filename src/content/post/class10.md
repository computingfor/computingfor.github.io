### Survey

Here is the survey I talked about in class: [https://forms.gle/t7SSm8smgwTwGwxN9](https://forms.gle/t7SSm8smgwTwGwxN9)

Submit it by 5:00pm tomorrow (Wednesday, 21 February).

### Schedule

[Project 2](/project2) is due on Friday, 23 February. As mentioned in class, setting up local editing for github is a bit more complicated than expected, so it is okay to skip steps 9 and 10 and Problem 5.
