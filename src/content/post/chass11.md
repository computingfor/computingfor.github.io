### Our Piece of the Internet

Check out [https://safetyschool.us/](https://safetyschool.us/)!

### Schedule

[Project 2](/project2) is due on Friday, 23 February. Please try to get the local editing for github working (and the directions with screenshots that Beenish posted on the Canvas site should help), but if you are stuck on this it is okay to skip steps 9 and 10 and Problem 5.
