Welcome back! The semester starts this week and our first class meeting will be on Thursday, January 18 (11:00am in
Olsson Hall 009).

A near-final version of the [Syllabus](/syllabus) is now posted. We'll talk about the plan for the course in the first class Thursday, but feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns you have.
