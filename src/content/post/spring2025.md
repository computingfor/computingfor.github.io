### Spring 2025 Course

A new version of **cs1010: Computing for Future Leaders and Global Citizens** will be offered in Spring 2025. Meetings are scheduled for
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00am - 12:15pm in Chemical Engineering 005.

You can get an idea of what the course will be like from last year's course website here. The [syllabus](/syllabus/) and other course information will be updated here later, but feel free to reach out to [me](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans) (evans@virginia.edu) with any questions.
