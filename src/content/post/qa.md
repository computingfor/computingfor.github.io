Here are my responses to your responses to the question "What do you want to know about me or the course?" on the "Beginning of Course Survey". If you think of any new questions you would like answered, or follow-ups on these, feel free to ask them in the Canvas discussion or by email!



<div class="question">
In SIS it's called Foundations of IT, so is it the same course with a different name? Or is the SIS description not relevant to this class at all?
</div>
<div class="answer">

Since I had to look it up, the SIS description is here:
<blockquote>
<em> 
How computers create, preserve, manipulate and communicate information and the concepts and tools used to that end. Units include how computers work, web technologies, creating web pages, algorithms and logic, basic programming, and solving problems with spreadsheets. Students will learn to recognize computational problems and develop basic skill sets to solve future problems in their discipline of study. No prior programming experience required. Cannot be taken for credit by students in SEAS.
</em>
</blockquote>
It is not as bad a description as I had feared, and overlaps around 80% with what we will do in this course.

<div class="question">
Will these course cover any of the technology used in blockchains/cryptocurrencies?
</div>
<div class="answer">

We'll definitely talk about the underlying technologies used in blockchains. I expect we'll also have a class on how cryptocurrencies work and fail (and asking this question increases the likelihood!). In 2015, I taught a [full course on cryptocurrencies](https://bitcoin-class.org/), and there are many very interesting technical ideas involve in blockchain and cryptocurrency. I'm mostly disappointed, though, in how things have evolved since then.

why did you choose to teach this class?

What to you is the most interesting thing we will learn this semester? 


What made you want to teach a course like this?

Why did you decide to instruct the course?

I'm wondering what is the reason why you are interested in teaching a course for non CS majors compared to CS  majors. (since you told us in class that you were wanting to teach this course already for a long time)

What do you find fulfilling about learning/teaching CS?


Will we be doing any coding or is the course more conceptual?

What interesting things are we going to do with coding in this class?


Maybe a little bit about your background like where you are from and how you got to UVA. 

I would just like to get to know you as a professor and genuinely learn the information in the course. I find the curriculum of this course much more interesting than most courses I have taken at college.

<div class="question">
Are the lectures solid?
</div>
<div class="answer">
I guess you'll form your own opinion on this as the semester goes on, but my answer would be that they are more liquid than solid. I definitely start with some structure in mind and try to design lectures that follow a coherent story, while covering the ideas I think are more worthwhile and interesting, but am also flexible in going off on tangents based on student questions or things that come up, and not worried if I don't finish everything that was planned for a class.
