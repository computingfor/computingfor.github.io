### Recommended Readings

These two chapters from my book, [_Introduction to Computing: Explorations in Language, Logic, and Machines_](https://computingbook.org/), are recommended readings that align closely with what we did in class:

- [Chapter 2: Language](https://computingbook.org/Language.pdf)
- [Chapter 3: Programming](https://computingbook.org/Programming.pdf)

Note that the Scheme language used in Chapter 3 is syntactically quite different from JavaScript, so don't get confused by the examples there. In other ways, JavaScript is very similar to the Scheme language used in the book &mdash; indeed, Brendan Eich's was hired by Netscape to design "Scheme for the web", which ended up being branded for marketing reasons as JavaScript.

### Code Examples
