## Information

**Information is an abstract mathematical notion.** To store, transmit, and manipulate information, though, it has to be represented in some **physical way**. At some level, everything in the physical world is continuous.

**Analog vs. Digital Data.** We can interpret a physical repesentation of information as either _analog_ or _digitial_ data. Analog data is _continuous_, with no limit on the number of different values (one way to think of this is that between any two values, there is another value). Digital data is _discrete_, where there is a fixed and finite set of possible values. There are gaps between the values.

**Interpretation of Physical Representations as Analog or Digital.** Although some physical representations are more naturally interpreted as analog or digital, what really matters is if the _interpretation_ of the state of the physical representation is continuous (analog) or discrete (digital). As a concrete example, a clock that ticks is digital, even if it looks like a traditional analog clock. Each tick advances the time by one second, and the physical representation (at least what we can see on the clock face, not the internal state of the springs and gears within the clock) is more naturally interpreted as one of a fixed set of discrete states (for a 12-hour clock, its a large set, but still a fixed and finite one with 60 &times; 60 &times; 12 different possible values).
