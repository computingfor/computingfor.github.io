### Schedule

[**Project 4**](/project4) is now posted and is due before the last class (10:59am, Tuesday, April 30). If you want to demo your Project 4, send me an email including a link to your bot or shared interaction before 10:00am on Tuesday.

**Optional Final Exam schedule:**

- I will post a “pre-final” after class Tuesday: written questions, you can use any resources you want but cannot discuss with other people
- Before 9am Wednesday, I will email you your grade if you don’t take the final
- If you want a better grade, you can schedule a final exam: slots will be available Thursday (May 2) 9am-noon and Friday (May 3) 9am-11am (may provide more if necessary) 
- If you choose to take final, you should come with your written answers to the pre-final questions
- At your schedule final, I will ask you to explain your answers, ask follow-up questions, and may ask new questions (not related to questions on pre-final)
- Performance on final can improve or reduce grade
