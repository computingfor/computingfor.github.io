**UVA CS1010 Spring 2024**  
_Computing for Future Leaders and Citizens_
</center>

### Course Goals

This course has two main objectives:

1. Provide you with an understanding of computing that will help you better understand the world today and tomorrow.

2. Empower you to use computing better.

For both of these goals, we will aim to understand how computers work, what computers can and cannot do, the kinds of questions to ask before trusting a computing systems, and the potential risks when computing systems are misused or abused.

This course is loosely inspired by Richard Muller's [_Physics for Future Presidents_](https://muller.lbl.gov/teaching/Physics10/PffP.html) course at Berkeley (and also a [popular book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_for_Future_Presidents)). That course aimed to cover what every future world leader needs to understand about physics, including topics like climate change, nuclear weapons, and communications.

Today's world leaders still need to understand physics, of course, but the need to understand computing is at least as essential. Whether you aspire to create a buisness, teach in middle school, become a doctor, or nearly any other future occupation including just being a functioning citizen in the modern world, computers will have a dramatic impact on your lives. Understanding enough about how computing systems work and how they are built and deployed is essential for being an informed citizen and making critical decisions that impact yourself and others.

### Meetings

Tuesdays and Thursdays, 11:00am-12:15pm in Olsson Hall 009.

### Teacher

[David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans)

I've been teaching at UVA for nearly 24 years and wanted to teach a course like this for many years, but this is my first time teaching this course. I've taught a [wide variety of other courses](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/courses/), ranging from [theoretical computer science](https://uvatoc.github.io/) and [operating systems](https://www.rust-class.org/) to [biological computing](https://computingbiology.github.io/) and [generative AI](http://llmrisks.github.io/).


### Course Approach

I realize this is not a required class for anyone, and that it doesn't count toward satisfying any vexing degree requirements, so hopefully that means everyone here is taking the course because they want to!

I also appreciate that this should mean that it is a _low stress course without excessive workload_. I aim to make the course satisfy that expectation, while being as worthwhile and fulfilling as possible. To that end, the course is designed with the expectation that much of the learning in the course will happen during class time, and I will do my best to make classes as engaging as possible. Success of this depends a lot on students in the class coming to class with a good attitude, open mind, and willingness to participate fully.

### Assignments and Activities

**Class Meetings.** Students are expected to attend and participate actively in all class meetings. I won't take attendance for the sake of taking attendance, but there will often be activities such as quizzes and group discussions in class where students will be recorded. Of course, there are sometimes good reasons students are not able to make it to class, and if a student with a justifiable reason for missing class isn't able to participate occasionally, I won't hold it against you, but it is your responsibility to let me know. If you are unable to come to class, you should submit the [Missing Class Form](https://forms.gle/Y4gRBfXoqZbc4iJa7). 

**Readings.** There is no textbook for the course. There will be a variety of readings (and occasionally viewings or listenings) assigned. Some reading assignments will be intended as preparation or postreflection for material we discuss in class. Others will be needed to answer questions well on homeworks.  I will limit required readings to openly available materials (and favor materials available under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses, but will also include copyrighted materials under academic fair use), although there may occasionally be recommended optional materials that are not openly available.

**On-Line Discussion (including weekly news article).**  I hope the class with have a vibrant on-line discussion forum, and expect all students in the class to contribute to an engaging, respectful, and intellectually and personally rewarding discussion.  As part of this, each student in the class is expected to contribute at least once each week by either (a) posting a link to a news article that has some relevance to computing, with a comment that (1) briefly summarizes the main point of the articls, (2) explains explains why you found the article interesting, and (3) asks a question you have about something in the article (good questions will be about some technical aspect or term in the article, or questioning the validity of some statement in article) or (b) respond in a meaningful way to an article that another student has posted, including an attempt to answer the question they asked. 

**Quizzes.**

**Homeworks.**
